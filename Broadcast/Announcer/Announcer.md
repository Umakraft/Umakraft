# Announcer

## Purpose

The **Announcer** is the final stage of the Broadcast pipeline — the delivery engine.

Announcer receives a fully-loaded notification record from Archive-Transporter and
executes the delivery plan step by step: rendering the image card via
`Workshop/Fabricator`, posting to the Discord channel, and sending DMs to each
qualifying recipient.

Announcer no longer reads from Archive itself at the start of delivery. Archive-Transporter
owns the fetch step and hands Announcer the complete record. Announcer only writes back
to Archive — to update delivery flags and append history rows after each step.

After each successful step, Announcer updates the corresponding flag in Archive.
If a step fails, Announcer leaves the flag at 0 and returns — the next Broker run will
surface the incomplete record through Archive-Transporter, which will call Announcer again.

---

## Responsibilities

1. **Receive the full record** — accept the complete notification record (delivery plan +
   payload + current flag states) pre-fetched from Archive by Archive-Transporter.

2. **Check each flag** — for each delivery step, check whether the flag is already 1.
   If yes, skip that step entirely. This is what prevents duplicate sends on retry.

3. **Render image card** — request the image card from `Workshop/Fabricator` using the
   `imageParams` stored in the record's payload. Announcer does not render cards itself.

4. **Post to channel** — post the rendered card and message text to each configured
   Discord channel in the recipients list. On success → `Archive.markChannelSent()`.

5. **Send member DMs** — send the individual DM to each `viewerId` in `memberDms`.
   On success → `Archive.markDmMemberSent()`.

6. **Send leader DM** — send the leader DM if `leaderDm` is set in the recipients.
   On success → `Archive.markDmLeaderSent()`.

7. **Record history** — after each step attempt (success or failure) →
   `Archive.recordHistory()` with outcome and Discord error code if applicable.

Announcer never evaluates eligibility, checks dedup, selects variants, reads new claim
records from Archive, or fetches data. It delivers what it receives, exactly once per step.

## Input

A fully-loaded notification record, passed by Archive-Transporter:

```javascript
await announcer.deliver(record, client)
```

The full record Announcer receives from Archive-Transporter:

```json
{
  "notificationKey": "daily-warning:circle-001:2026-07-19",
  "type": "dailyWarning",
  "circleId": "circle-001",
  "claimedAt": "2026-07-19T23:45:01.000Z",
  "channelSent": 0,
  "dmMemberSent": 0,
  "dmLeaderSent": 0,
  "recipients": {
    "channels": ["channel-id-1"],
    "memberDms": ["viewer-id-1", "viewer-id-2"],
    "leaderDm": null
  },
  "payload": {
    "variant": 12,
    "fanTotal": 842000,
    "goal": 1000000,
    "message": "Your daily fan gain did not reach the goal...",
    "imageParams": { "type": "dailyWarning", "fanTotal": 842000, "goal": 1000000 }
  }
}
```

## Delivery Steps

Steps always run in this fixed order. Each step is skipped if its flag is already 1.

```text
1. render card       Workshop/Fabricator.render(payload.imageParams) → Buffer
2. post to channel   client.channel.send(embed + attachment)
                     → Archive.markChannelSent()
                     → Archive.recordHistory('channel', 'success')
3. send member DMs   utils/dm.dmByViewerId(viewerId, ...) for each recipient
                     → Archive.markDmMemberSent()
                     → Archive.recordHistory('dm_member', 'success')
4. send leader DM    utils/dm.dmLeader(circleId, ...)  [if recipients.leaderDm is set]
                     → Archive.markDmLeaderSent()
                     → Archive.recordHistory('dm_leader', 'success')
```

---

## Failure Handling

When a Discord API call fails at any step:

- Log the error with `notificationKey`, step name, and Discord error code.
- Call `Archive.recordHistory(notificationKey, { step, outcome: 'failure', discordCode })`.
- Leave the delivery flag at 0.
- Return immediately — do not retry in the same run.

On the next Broker cron tick, `Archive.getIncomplete()` will surface this record
again. Broker routes the `notificationKey` to Archive-Transporter, which re-fetches
the record and calls `Announcer.deliver()` again. Only the failed step will be
re-attempted — steps already at flag = 1 are skipped.

Announcer never enters a retry loop itself. Retry cadence is the Broker cron interval.

---

## Render Delegation

Announcer calls `Workshop/Fabricator` to render image cards. It passes `imageParams`
from the record payload (pre-loaded by Archive-Transporter) and receives a `Buffer` back.

```javascript
const cardBuffer = await fabricator.render(record.payload.imageParams)
const attachment = bufferToAttachment(cardBuffer, buildReportFilename(record.type))
```

Fabricator renders — Announcer delivers. Announcer never contains HTML, SVG, canvas,
or Playwright code. That boundary is absolute.

---

## Interface

```javascript
// Deliver a notification. Called by Archive-Transporter (new delivery and restart recovery).
// Receives the full pre-fetched record — no Archive read at the start.
await announcer.deliver(record, client)

// Internal step handlers
await announcer._postChannel(record, cardBuffer, client)
await announcer._sendMemberDms(record, cardBuffer, client)
await announcer._sendLeaderDm(record, cardBuffer, client)
```

---

## Workflow

```text
Archive-Transporter fetches record from Archive → passes full record to Announcer

     │
     ▼
Announcer.deliver(record, client)
     │
     ├── record.channelSent = 0?
     │     → Fabricator.render(payload.imageParams) → buffer
     │     → post to each channel
     │     → Archive.markChannelSent()
     │     → Archive.recordHistory('channel', 'success')
     │
     ├── record.dmMemberSent = 0?
     │     → for each viewerId in recipients.memberDms:
     │         → dm.dmByViewerId(viewerId, embed + attachment)
     │     → Archive.markDmMemberSent()
     │     → Archive.recordHistory('dm_member', 'success')
     │
     └── record.dmLeaderSent = 0 AND recipients.leaderDm set?
           → dm.dmLeader(circleId, embed + attachment)
           → Archive.markDmLeaderSent()
           → Archive.recordHistory('dm_leader', 'success')
```

## Design Principle

Announcer is stateless and trustful.

By the time Announcer is called, every decision has already been made and recorded:
Archive-Inspector approved the notification, Archive wrote the full record, and
Archive-Transporter fetched and validated that record before handing it over.
Announcer receives a complete, ready-to-execute delivery plan and acts on it faithfully
— no eligibility logic, no dedup queries, no variant pools, no Archive reads at the start.

This makes Announcer independently testable — hand it any well-formed record and a mock
Discord client, and it will attempt exactly the steps the record specifies.

## Current Source Files

Delivery logic extracted into Announcer from these files.
Note: the render portions of these files move to `Workshop/Fabricator/renders/`.

| Current file | Delivery logic → Announcer |
|---|---|
| `fantracking/milestone/notifier.js` | `sendChannelAnnouncement()`, DM sends, `retrySends()` |
| `fantracking/leaderboard/announcements.js` | Channel post + top-3 DMs |
| `fantracking/warnings/imageReport.js` | Warning image report channel post |
| `tasks/fanDeficitImageReport.js` | Fan deficit report channel post |

## Version History

- `v1.0` — Initial Announcer specification
- `v1.1` — Announcer now reads from Archive by notificationKey; does not receive
  payload directly from Inspector; all delivery state sourced from Archive only
- `v1.2` — Announcer no longer reads from Archive at the start of delivery;
  Archive-Transporter now owns the fetch step and passes the full record directly;
  `deliver()` signature changed from `(notificationKey, client)` to `(record, client)`
