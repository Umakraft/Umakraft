# Broadcast Architecture Overview

## Purpose

The **Broadcast** directory is the event-notification pipeline of UmaKraft Circle Bot.

It handles all push notifications — greetings, warnings, achievements, milestones,
leaderboard announcements, and offline checks — that fire automatically based on a
cron schedule or a data threshold without any user request.

Broadcast is a sibling of Workshop, not an extension of it. Both consume data from
`Refinery/Depot`, but they serve entirely different models:

| | Workshop | Broadcast |
|---|---|---|
| **Trigger** | User runs a slash command | Cron fires or data threshold crossed |
| **Recipients** | One (the requester) | Many (channel + N member DMs + leader DM) |
| **Dedup** | Not needed | Critical — Archive prevents double-fires across restarts |
| **State** | Stateless | Stateful — Archive-Inspector claims in Archive; Announcer marks each step |
| **Retry** | Discord handles | Announcer retries flagged steps found by Broker on restart |

## Pipeline

```text
Refinery/Depot
     │
     ▼  ← Broker fetches raw computed data
   Broker
     │  ← passes raw data to Archive-Inspector
     ▼
   Archive-Inspector
     │  ← if approved: writes full notification record to Archive
     │  ← if rejected: drops cleanly, nothing written
     ▼
   Archive  (pure storage)
     │  ← Archive-Transporter reads the notification record
     ▼
   Archive-Transporter
     │  ← fetches full record (incl. imageParams) and hands it to Announcer
     ▼
   Announcer
     │  ← render card → post channel → send DMs → update Archive flags
     ▼
   Discord (channel posts, member DMs, leader DMs)
```

On bot restart, Broker reads Archive for records with any delivery flag still at 0
and routes those `notificationKey` values to Archive-Transporter — which re-fetches
the full record and passes it to Announcer, skipping Archive-Inspector entirely since
those notifications were already approved and claimed before the restart.

## Department Responsibilities

### Broker

The entry point of the Broadcast pipeline. Broker is triggered by a cron schedule
or data threshold event. When triggered, it fetches the relevant compiled data from
`Refinery/Depot` and hands it to Archive-Inspector as raw input.

Broker does not decide whether a notification should fire — that is Archive-Inspector's
job. It only knows **when** to run and **what data to fetch**.

On restart, Broker also reads Archive for incomplete delivery records (any flag = 0)
and routes those `notificationKey` values to Archive-Transporter for recovery — bypassing
Archive-Inspector since those notifications were already approved.

### Archive-Inspector

The decision-maker and the sole creator of Archive records.

Archive-Inspector receives raw Refinery data from Broker and runs every check in order:

1. **Eligibility** — does the data meet the threshold? Grace period over? Tally still open?
2. **Dedup** — does an Archive record for this `notificationKey` already exist?
3. **Recipient resolution** — which channels, which member DMs, whether leader DM needed
4. **Variant selection** — picks message content and image parameters from the pool

If any check fails → Archive-Inspector rejects the job cleanly. Nothing is written.

If all checks pass → Archive-Inspector writes the full notification record (delivery plan +
payload + flags all at 0) to Archive, then passes the `notificationKey` to Archive-Transporter.

Archive-Inspector is the **only** department that creates new Archive records.

### Archive

Pure storage. Archive holds notification records and delivery state. It contains no
pipeline logic — it only stores what Archive-Inspector writes and serves what
Archive-Transporter and Announcer read.

| Operation | Caller |
|---|---|
| `INSERT` new notification record | Archive-Inspector only |
| `SELECT` by key | Archive-Transporter |
| `UPDATE` delivery flags (`channel_sent`, `dm_member_sent`, `dm_leader_sent`) | Announcer only |
| `SELECT` incomplete records for restart recovery | Broker only |
| `INSERT` delivery history row | Announcer only |

Archive exposes a clean interface for each caller. No caller reaches into the database
directly — all access goes through Archive's interface.

### Archive-Transporter

The fetch-and-handoff stage between Archive and Announcer.

Archive-Transporter receives a `notificationKey` from Archive-Inspector (new delivery)
or from Broker (restart recovery). It reads the full notification record from Archive —
including all `imageParams` needed for fabrication — validates it, and passes the
complete record to Announcer.

Announcer always receives its data via Archive-Transporter. This means Announcer never
reads from Archive itself at the start of delivery — it only writes back to Archive
(flag updates, history rows) after each step completes.

### Announcer

The delivery engine. Announcer receives a fully-loaded notification record from
Archive-Transporter and executes the delivery plan step by step.

For each step:
1. Check the flag — if already 1, skip.
2. Execute the step (render card via Fabricator, post to channel, send DM).
3. On success → update the flag in Archive → append history row.
4. On failure → log the error → leave the flag at 0 → return (Broker will surface
   the record again on the next run via Archive-Transporter for retry).

Announcer never re-evaluates eligibility and never reads its initial record from Archive.
It delivers what Archive-Transporter hands it, exactly once per step.

## Restart-Safety Contract

```text
Bot restarts mid-delivery (channel posted, DMs not yet sent):

  Archive record:
    channel_sent   = 1   ← already done, skip
    dm_member_sent = 0   ← not yet done
    dm_leader_sent = 0   ← not yet done

  On next Broker run:
    Broker reads Archive.getIncomplete()
    → routes notificationKey to Archive-Transporter
    Archive-Transporter fetches full record from Archive
    → passes record to Announcer
    Announcer checks each flag:
    → channel step: flag=1, skip
    → member DM step: flag=0, execute
    → leader DM step: flag=0, execute
    Result: no duplicate channel post; no missed DMs
```

## Relationship with Other Directories

| | Direction | What is exchanged |
|---|---|---|
| `Refinery/Depot` | Broker reads | Compiled products, computed threshold values |
| `Workshop/Fabricator` | Announcer calls | Image card render requests (Fabricator renders, Announcer delivers) |
| `Broadcast/Archive` | Archive-Inspector writes; Archive-Transporter reads; Announcer updates flags; Broker reads incomplete | Notification records and delivery flags |
| Discord | Announcer writes | Channel posts, member DMs, leader DMs |

Broadcast never imports from Workshop/Terminal, Distribution, or Umamoe.

---

## Adding a New Notification Type

1. **Archive-Inspector** — add the eligibility rule, dedup key format, recipient resolver, and variant pool
2. **Archive** — add the Archive schema entry if a new `notificationKey` format is needed (usually the existing schema covers it)
3. **Workshop/Fabricator** — add the render template for the image card
4. **Announcer** — add the delivery handler for the new type
5. **Broker** — add the data fetch logic and cron registration
6. **`tasks/index.js`** — register the cron schedule

No other directory needs to change.

## Version History

- `v1.0` — Initial Broadcast architecture specification
- `v1.1` — Clarified department boundaries: Inspector is sole Archive writer; Broker is
  data courier only; Archive is pure storage; Announcer reads Archive to execute delivery
- `v1.2` — Inspector renamed to Archive-Inspector; Archive-Transporter introduced as
  the fetch-and-handoff stage between Archive and Announcer; Announcer no longer reads
  from Archive at the start of delivery; all paths into Announcer now go through
  Archive-Transporter
