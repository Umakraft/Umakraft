# Archive

## Purpose

The **Archive** is the notification state store of the Broadcast pipeline.

Archive is pure storage. It holds no pipeline logic, makes no decisions, and performs
no eligibility checks. It stores exactly what Archive-Inspector writes and serves exactly
what Archive-Transporter, Announcer, and Broker request.

Its schema and interface are designed so that the full delivery state of every
notification is visible at a glance and recoverable after a bot restart.

---

## Responsibilities

Archive has four responsibilities and no others:

1. **Store** — accept a new notification record written by Archive-Inspector.
2. **Serve** — return a notification record to Announcer by `notificationKey`.
3. **Surface** — return incomplete records (any delivery flag = 0) to Broker for restart recovery.
4. **Prune** — delete records older than the retention window on a scheduled basis.

Archive does not evaluate eligibility, resolve recipients, select variants, render
content, or send to Discord.

## Who Calls Archive

| Operation | Caller | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `INSERT` new record | Archive-Inspector only | Full notification record written on approval |
| `SELECT` by key | Archive-Transporter | Fetch the full delivery plan and payload for handoff to Announcer |
| `UPDATE` delivery flag | Announcer only | Mark each step complete after success |
| `INSERT` history row | Announcer only | Append delivery attempt outcome |
| `SELECT` incomplete | Broker only | Find records with any flag = 0 for restart recovery |
| `DELETE` old records | Scheduled prune | Age-based retention cleanup |

No other department reads or writes Archive directly.

## Schema

### `broadcast_claims` table

One record per notification event. Primary key is `notification_key`.
Created by Archive-Inspector via `INSERT OR IGNORE` — a second insert for the same key is a no-op.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS broadcast_claims (
  notification_key  TEXT    NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
  type              TEXT    NOT NULL,
  circle_id         TEXT    NOT NULL,
  claimed_at        TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  channel_sent      INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  dm_member_sent    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  dm_leader_sent    INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  channel_msg_id    TEXT,
  channel_id        TEXT,
  guild_id          TEXT,
  payload_json      TEXT    NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bc_type_circle
  ON broadcast_claims(type, circle_id);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bc_incomplete
  ON broadcast_claims(channel_sent, dm_member_sent, dm_leader_sent);
```

`payload_json` stores the full notification record serialized by Archive-Inspector — recipients,
variant selection, image parameters, and message content. Archive-Transporter reads this and
passes it to Announcer to execute the delivery plan without re-running Archive-Inspector.

### `broadcast_history` table

Append-only audit log. One row per delivery step attempt. Written by Announcer only.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS broadcast_history (
  id                INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  notification_key  TEXT    NOT NULL,
  step              TEXT    NOT NULL,
  outcome           TEXT    NOT NULL,
  discord_code      INTEGER,
  attempted_at      TEXT    NOT NULL DEFAULT (datetime('now')),
  detail            TEXT,
  FOREIGN KEY (notification_key) REFERENCES broadcast_claims(notification_key)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_bh_key ON broadcast_history(notification_key);
```

`step` values: `'channel'` | `'dm_member'` | `'dm_leader'`
`outcome` values: `'success'` | `'failure'`

---

## Interface

```javascript
// Called by Archive-Inspector: insert a new notification record
// Uses INSERT OR IGNORE — safe to call multiple times for the same key
await archive.insert(record)
/*
  record = {
    notificationKey,  type,  circleId,
    recipients,       payload
  }
*/

// Called by Announcer: read a full notification record
const record = await archive.get(notificationKey)

// Called by Broker: find all incomplete records for a circle (any flag = 0)
const records = await archive.getIncomplete(circleId)

// Called by Announcer: mark a delivery step complete
await archive.markChannelSent(notificationKey, { channelMsgId, channelId, guildId })
await archive.markDmMemberSent(notificationKey)
await archive.markDmLeaderSent(notificationKey)

// Called by Announcer: append a delivery attempt to the history log
await archive.recordHistory(notificationKey, { step, outcome, discordCode, detail })

// Called by scheduled task: remove records older than retention window
await archive.prune({ olderThanDays })

// Initialize database and run migrations
await archive.init()
```

---

## Adapter Contract

Archive is implemented via an adapter so local development and tests use an in-memory
store without touching SQLite.

```javascript
// In-memory adapter (tests and local dev)
const archive = createArchiveAdapter('inmemory')

// SQLite adapter (production)
const archive = createArchiveAdapter('sqlite', { dbPath })
```

Both adapters implement the full interface with identical semantics. The in-memory
adapter is not durable — data is lost on process exit.

---

## Migration from Existing Databases

The Archive unifies three separate notification databases that currently exist in production:

| Current file | Current table(s) | Migrates to Archive |
|---|---|---|
| `fantracking/milestone/db.js` | `milestone_fired` | `broadcast_claims` + `broadcast_history` |
| `fantracking/warnings/db.js` | `warning_state`, `warning_history` | `broadcast_claims` + `broadcast_history` |
| `fantracking/achievements/db.js` | `member_achievements` | `broadcast_claims` + `broadcast_history` |

**Migration rules on first boot:**
- Records with all delivery flags = 1 → import as fully sent (dedup protection preserved)
- Records with any delivery flag = 0 → import as incomplete (Broker will surface them for Announcer retry)
- `payload_json` is reconstructed from the existing record where possible; otherwise
  the record is marked as fully sent to avoid a broken retry

## Restart-Safety Illustration

```text
Scenario: Bot restarts after channel post succeeds but before DMs are sent.

broadcast_claims record:
  notification_key = "daily-warning:circle-001:2026-07-19"
  channel_sent     = 1   ← done
  dm_member_sent   = 0   ← not done
  dm_leader_sent   = 0   ← not applicable (null recipients)

On next Broker.run():
  archive.getIncomplete('circle-001')
  → returns this record
  → Broker routes notificationKey to Announcer

Announcer reads record:
  → channel step:    flag=1, skip
  → member DM step:  flag=0, execute → markDmMemberSent() on success
  → leader DM step:  no recipient, skip

Result: no duplicate channel post, no missed DMs.
```

---

## Design Principle

Archive is a ledger, not a processor.

Every record in Archive was written by Archive-Inspector — meaning it was explicitly
approved, deduplicated, and had its delivery plan resolved before it was stored.
Archive-Transporter fetches the record and hands it to Announcer, which delivers
without re-evaluating anything.

The atomic `INSERT OR IGNORE` on `notification_key` is the single guarantee that
prevents duplicate notifications. Everything else in the Broadcast pipeline depends
on this guarantee holding.

## Current Source Files

Logic and schema extracted into Archive from these files:

| Current file | Archive responsibility |
|---|---|
| `fantracking/milestone/db.js` | Claim record, `channel_sent`/`dm_*_sent` flags, `milestone_fired` schema |
| `fantracking/warnings/db.js` | Warning state per trainer per day, `warning_history` audit log |
| `fantracking/achievements/db.js` | Achievement record per trainer per tier per month |

## Version History

- `v1.0` — Initial Archive specification
- `v1.1` — Redefined as pure storage: Inspector is sole record creator; Announcer is
  sole flag updater; Broker is sole incomplete-record reader; no pipeline logic in Archive
- `v1.2` — Inspector renamed to Archive-Inspector; Archive-Transporter is now the
  sole caller of `SELECT by key` (previously Announcer); Announcer no longer reads
  from Archive at the start of delivery
