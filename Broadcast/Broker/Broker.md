# Broker

## Purpose

The **Broker** is the entry point and data courier of the Broadcast pipeline.

When triggered by a cron schedule or a threshold event, Broker fetches the relevant
compiled data from `Refinery/Depot` and hands it to Archive-Inspector as raw input for
evaluation. Broker does not decide whether a notification should fire — that is
Archive-Inspector's job.

On bot restart, Broker also reads Archive for incomplete delivery records and routes
those `notificationKey` values to Archive-Transporter, bypassing Archive-Inspector
entirely (those were already approved before the restart). Archive-Transporter then
re-fetches the full record and hands it to Announcer.

---

## Responsibilities

1. Receive the cron trigger or threshold event for a specific notification type and circle.
2. Fetch the relevant compiled product(s) from `Refinery/Depot` for that circle and period.
3. Build the raw notification input envelope from the fetched data.
4. Pass the raw input to Archive-Inspector.
5. On restart: read Archive for records with any delivery flag still at 0 and route their
   `notificationKey` values to Archive-Transporter (skip Archive-Inspector — those were
   already approved before the restart).
6. Manage the per-circle queue so one failing circle never blocks another.

Broker does not evaluate eligibility, resolve recipients, select variants, write to
Archive, fetch from Archive, or send to Discord.

## What Broker Fetches from Refinery

Broker knows what type of data each notification type needs and fetches exactly that
from `Refinery/Depot`:

| Notification type | What Broker fetches from Depot |
|---|---|
| Daily warning | Circle daily fan total for today |
| Achievement tier | Circle hourly fan total + tier thresholds |
| Milestone | Per-trainer monthly fan total + tier config |
| Leaderboard | Compiled leaderboard snapshot for today/week |
| Greeting | Member roster with linked status + timezones |
| Offline check | Member last-seen timestamps |
| Weekly / monthly warning | Circle period totals for the relevant window |
| Inter-circle | Multi-circle compiled snapshot |

---

## Raw Input Envelope

The envelope Broker builds and hands to Archive-Inspector:

```json
{
  "type": "dailyWarning",
  "circleId": "circle-001",
  "fetchedAt": "2026-07-19T23:45:00.000Z",
  "data": {
    "fanTotal": 842000,
    "memberStats": [ ... ],
    "snapshotDate": "2026-07-19",
    "depotRef": "depot-product-id-xyz"
  }
}
```

`data` contains exactly what was fetched from Refinery/Depot — no derived values,
no eligibility conclusions, no recipient lists. That computation belongs to Archive-Inspector.

---

## Restart Recovery

On every startup and before each cron tick, Broker reads Archive for incomplete records:

```text
Archive.getIncomplete(circleId)
  → records where channel_sent=0 OR dm_member_sent=0 OR dm_leader_sent=0

For each incomplete record:
  → route notificationKey to Archive-Transporter
  → skip Archive-Inspector (notification was already approved before restart)
  → Archive-Transporter fetches full record and passes it to Announcer
```

This ensures deliveries that were interrupted by a crash or restart are completed
without re-evaluating eligibility or creating duplicate Archive records.

---

## Per-Circle Queue

Broker runs notification jobs for each configured circle sequentially and in isolation:

```text
for each circle in getConfiguredCircles():
  try:
    data = Depot.fetch(type, circleId)
    ArchiveInspector.evaluate({ type, circleId, data })
  catch error:
    log error, continue to next circle
```

One failing circle never blocks others.

---

## Interface

```javascript
// Called by tasks/index.js on cron tick
await broker.run(type, client)

// Internal: fetch data from Refinery/Depot for a given type + circle
await broker._fetch(type, circleId)

// Internal: on startup, find incomplete Archive records and route to Archive-Transporter
await broker._recoverIncomplete(circleId, client)
```

---

## Workflow

```text
tasks/index.js (cron schedule fires)
     │
     ▼
Broker.run(type, client)
     │
     ├── broker._recoverIncomplete()
     │     → Archive.getIncomplete(circleId)
     │     → ArchiveTransporter.fetch(notificationKey, client)   [retry path]
     │
     └── for each circle:
           → Depot.fetch(type, circleId) → raw data
           → ArchiveInspector.evaluate({ type, circleId, data })
```

---

## Design Principle

Broker is a courier, not a judge.

It knows when to run and what data to fetch. It does not know whether the data
qualifies as a notification event — that is Archive-Inspector's job. This separation
means Broker can be tested with mock Depot data regardless of any eligibility logic,
and eligibility rules can be changed in Archive-Inspector without touching Broker.

## Current Source Files

Logic extracted into Broker from these files:

| Current file | Broker responsibility |
|---|---|
| `fantracking/milestone/milestones.js` | Per-circle queue, restart recovery, boot-time guard |
| `tasks/dailyGreetingReport.js` | Cron trigger, member roster fetch |
| `tasks/dailyMessages.js` | Per-timezone hour check, member fetch |
| `tasks/offlineCheck.js` | Days-offline threshold, last-seen fetch |
| `tasks/weeklyAnnouncement.js` | Weekly tally event, snapshot fetch |
| `tasks/interCircleAnnouncements.js` | Multi-circle snapshot fetch |

---

## Version History

- `v1.0` — Initial Broker specification
- `v1.1` — Clarified Broker as data courier only; data fetch from Refinery is primary
  responsibility; eligibility decisions belong entirely to Inspector
- `v1.2` — Inspector renamed to Archive-Inspector; restart recovery now routes
  notificationKey values to Archive-Transporter instead of Announcer directly
