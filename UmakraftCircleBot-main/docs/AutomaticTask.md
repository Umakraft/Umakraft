# Automatic Tasks

All tasks that run automatically on a time schedule (cron jobs) or triggered by a Discord event. No manual command is needed to fire these.

> **Scope:** This document covers cron-scheduled tasks and Discord event-driven automations only. One-time startup jobs (sync, recovery, import) that run when the bot first comes online are not listed here.

All cron times are in the bot's configured timezone (default: **Asia/Tokyo / JST**).

## ⏱️ Internal Timers & Utilities

|----------|---------|--------------|
| `tasks/index.js` | 3s, 5s, 8s delays on startup | Staggers initialization API calls to avoid rate limits |
| `utils/autoDelete.js` | `setTimeout` (default 60s) | Auto-deletes ephemeral bot messages after a configurable delay |
| `core/umaQueue.js` | 500ms enforced gap | Rate-limits outgoing requests to the uma.moe API |
