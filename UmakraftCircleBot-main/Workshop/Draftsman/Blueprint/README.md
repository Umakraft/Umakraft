# Blueprint Department

## Purpose

The **Blueprint** directory stores the official design specifications for every product manufactured within the Workshop.

A blueprint describes **how a product should be constructed**, including its layout, components, visual structure, and presentation requirements.

Blueprints are design specifications only.

They never contain rendering logic or business logic.

- Validate finished products
- Distribute products
