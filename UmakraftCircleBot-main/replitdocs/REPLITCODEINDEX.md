# REPLITCODEINDEX.md
# Repository Navigation Map

## Purpose
This file is the primary navigation guide for the repository.
It is NOT intended to document every function.
Instead it provides a high-level map to locate files, features,
commands, database tables, and code flows quickly.
Use this file before searching the repository.

# AI INSTRUCTIONS

Before searching the repository:
1. Read REPLITCODEINDEX.md first.
2. Use the File Locator to find the correct directory.
3. Use the Command Index for slash command work.
4. Use the Database Index for any schema-related work.
5. Use the Feature Flow Map to understand multi-file chains.
6. Update this file when a new command, table, task, or
   major workflow is added. Do NOT document every function —
   document where functionality lives.
7. replit.md is the authoritative project spec.
   This file is the navigation map. Both must stay in sync.

Last Updated: 2026-07-08 (feature-directory reorg — milestone/, warnings/, leaderboard/,
onboarding/, archive/, achievements/, attendance/, links/ each hold their own logic;
one-line shim files preserve every old tasks/*.js and db/*.js import path)
