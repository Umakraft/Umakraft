/**
 * umaQueue — global request queue for all uma.moe API calls.
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *   1. Minimum 500ms gap between any two consecutive requests (never exceeds 2 req/sec).
 *   2. Requests are serialised — only one is in-flight at a time. If a request
 *      receives a 429 and backs off inside fetchWithRetry(), the entire queue
 *      waits for it naturally (no separate global-pause mechanism needed).
 *   3. Hourly budget monitor — logs a warning if > 100 requests fire in one hour
 *      so runaway tasks are caught before they become a flooding problem.
