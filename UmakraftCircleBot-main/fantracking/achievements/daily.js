 * Checks whether the circle's total daily fan gain has crossed any milestone
 * tier (1M → 10M). Each tier fires at most once per JST calendar day and
 * persists across bot restarts and migrations (stored in SQLite via store).
 *
 * On trigger:
 *  • Randomly picks one of 5 announcement variants for that tier.
 *  • Posts the rendered image card to every guild's announcement channel,
 *    pinging all linked circle members in the message content.
 *  • DMs the image card to every linked circle member individually.
 *
 * Schedule: runs at :15 past every hour (15 min after hourly dataSync).
